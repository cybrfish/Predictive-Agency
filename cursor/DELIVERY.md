### ✅ What's Working Right Now
```bash

npm run dev      # ✅ Starts dev server
npm test         # ✅ Ready for tests (none written yet)
npm run check    # ✅ TypeScript validation
```

## 🎯 Next Action: Hand to Claude Code

### Option 1: Full Auto-Pilot
```bash
cd /home/claude/predictive-agency
claude-code
```

Then say:
> "Read GETTING_STARTED.md and implement Day 1 tasks from IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md. Complete Agent.ts, create DifferentialQ.ts, write unit tests."

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Control
```bash
cd /home/claude/predictive-agency
claude-code
```

Then give specific micro-tasks:
> "Complete the selectAction() method in src/core/Agent.ts with epsilon-greedy policy as specified in IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md Section II."

---

## 📊 Expected Timeline

**Day 1 (Today):** Core learning (Agent + DifferentialQ + tests)  
**Day 2:** Simulation loop + state dynamics  
**Day 3:** Boundary expansion + Power calculator  
**Day 4:** Minimal UI + plots  
**Day 5:** Validate both scenarios (Token vs Open Rails)  
**Day 6:** Bug fixes + hyperparameter tuning

**Phase 0 complete:** When r̄ converges and Beaver Test works

---

## 🎓 Core Concepts (Cheat Sheet)

### The Beaver Test
```
Draw boundary → Measure r* → Expand boundary → r* still positive?
✅ YES = Regenerative (Beaver)
❌ NO  = Extractive (Algae)
```

### Differential Q-Learning
```
δ = R - r̄ + max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)
Q ← Q + α δ
r̄ ← r̄ + β δ
```

### Alignment Coefficient
```
α = r*_ecosystem / r*_network
> 1 = regenerative
< 1 = extractive
```

### Per-Agent Metrics
```
P_i = Power (Shapley value)
A_i = Agency (immediate contribution)
k_i = Contribution (circulation - extraction)
```

---

## 🧪 Validation Checklist

**Phase 0 is done when:**
- [ ] `npm test` passes all unit tests
- [ ] r̄ converges by step 200
- [ ] Token scenario: α flips from >1 to <1 on boundary expansion (FAIL)
- [ ] Open Rails: α stays >1 through all boundaries (PASS)
- [ ] Plots visible in browser
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No NaN or explosions in simulation

**Then proceed to Phase 1** (sliders) and Phase 2 (Three.js).

## 🔥 Key Files Reference

### For Math & Theory
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` → Equations + implementation details
- `predictive-agency-framework.md` → Core theory explained

### For Implementation
- `src/core/types.ts` → All interfaces defined
- `src/scenarios/presets.ts` → Token vs Open Rails configs
- `src/core/Agent.ts` → Start here (has TODOs)

### For Testing
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` → Debugging tips + expected behavior
- `vitest.config.ts` → Test runner config

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test-Driven:** Write tests first, implement second
2. **Validate Early:** Check r̄ convergence after Day 1
3. **Tune Last:** Don't tweak hyperparameters until math works
4. **Visual Debug:** Add console.log for r̄ and α in simulation loop
5. **Reference Spec:** IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md has ALL the answers

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't:** Start with Three.js visualization  
✅ **Do:** Get math working first with simple plots

❌ **Don't:** Tune hyperparameters before validation  
✅ **Do:** Use default values until Beaver Test works

❌ **Don't:** Implement all features at once  
✅ **Do:** Follow the 6-day plan step-by-step

❌ **Don't:** Guess the equations  
✅ **Do:** Copy them exactly from IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md

---

## 🎤 The Demo Story (When Phase 0 Done)

**Hook:** "Can you design a system that gets MORE regenerative as it grows?"

**Demo Flow:**
1. Show Token Rideshare running
2. Point out r̄ converging, α > 1 at B_0
3. Hit "Expand Boundary" button
4. α flips to < 1 (RED)
5. Explain: "Looks good locally, extractive widely"
6. Switch to Open Rails scenario
7. Expand boundary multiple times
8. α stays green at all scales
9. **Kicker:** "This is the math. Not vibes. Beaver Test, quantified."

## 🏁 You're Ready

Everything is locked, documented, and ready to execute.

**The fries are in the bag. Let's ship this.** 🍟

*Next command:*
```bash
cd /home/claude/predictive-agency && claude-code
```

Then:
> "Implement Day 1 from IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md: complete Agent.ts, create DifferentialQ.ts, write unit tests."

**GO. 🚀**
