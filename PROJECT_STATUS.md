# Project Status: Predictive Agency Spatial Ecosystem

**Last Updated**: October 28, 2025  
**Version**: 0.2.0  
**Status**: ✅ Core simulation complete and running

## 🎉 What We Built Today

### Complete Rebuild: From Abstract to Spatial

**Before**: Abstract state pools with agents affecting global variables  
**After**: Living spatial grid with agents that move, extract, invest, and learn

### Core Components (All Complete ✅)

1. **EcosystemGrid** - Spatial substrate
   - 2D grid with local cell properties
   - Resource regeneration via diffusion
   - Cell modification through investment
   - Varied terrain generation

2. **SpatialAgent** - Autonomous learning entities
   - Movement, extraction, investment actions
   - Differential Q-learning (per-agent r̄)
   - Four strategies: Extractor, Investor, Balanced, Explorer
   - Energy-based survival

3. **SpatialSimulation** - Evolutionary dynamics
   - Population dynamics with death/respawn
   - Strategy propagation (successful strategies spread)
   - Interactive interventions
   - Emergent spatial patterns

4. **SpatialView** - Real-time visualization
   - Canvas-based rendering
   - Color-coded by resources and strategies
   - Agent size reflects energy
   - Cell modifications highlighted

5. **Interactive UI** - Full control panel
   - Play/Pause/Step/Reset
   - Intervention buttons (Deplete/Enrich/Add agents)
   - Configuration sliders
   - Real-time metrics dashboard

## 📊 What It Does

### The Experiment
Watch 100+ agents learn to balance extraction vs investment in a living ecosystem.

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Extractor waves**: Locusts that deplete regions and move on
- **Investor clusters**: Beavers that build resource-rich zones
- **Population cycles**: Boom → crash → recovery
- **Spatial patterns**: Wasteland vs wetland formation
- **Strategy evolution**: Successful behaviors propagate

### Key Insights Demonstrated
1. **Free energy alone doesn't tell the story** (distribution matters)
2. **Scale doesn't save extractive systems** (math proves it)
3. **Boundaries determine perception** (local vs global optimization)
4. **Long-term thinking emerges naturally** (r̄ converges)

## 🚧 What's Next (Future Roadmap)

### High Priority
1. **Dynamic Boundary Detection**
   - Cluster agents spatially (DBSCAN)
   - Compute r* per cluster
   - Visualize alignment coefficient
   - Demonstrate Beaver Test in action

2. **Multi-Agent Types**
   - Platform agents (set take rates)
   - Driver agents (labor)
   - Regulator agents (constraints)
   - Investor agents (capital)

3. **Additional Scenarios**
   - Rideshare ecosystem
   - Supply chain dynamics
   - Financial markets
   - Social networks

### Medium Priority
4. **Partial Observability**
   - Gaussian Belief Propagation
   - Noisy observations
   - Uncertainty visualization

5. **Power Metrics**
   - Shapley value computation
   - Agency attribution
   - Contribution tracking (k_i)

6. **Better Visualizations**
   - 3D terrain view
   - Sankey energy flows
   - Agent trails
   - Power field heatmap

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
7. Communication between agents
8. Coalition formation
9. Audio feedback
10. Real-world data integration

## 🐛 Known Issues

### None Currently! 🎉

The simulation is stable and performant. Previous issues fixed:
- ✅ Energy death spiral (fixed with regeneration)
- ✅ No recovery mechanism (fixed with respawn)
- ✅ Static boundaries (fixed with spatial structure)
- ✅ Lack of dynamics (fixed with emergent behaviors)

## 🧪 Recommended Experiments

Try these to see interesting behavior:

### 1. Extractor Dominance
```
Config: 80% extractors, 10% investors, 10% balanced
Result: Watch system collapse then recover as investors take over
```

### 2. Resource Shock
```
Action: Start balanced, then hit "Deplete Center" at t=500
Result: Agent migration patterns, strategy shifts
```

### 3. Investor Paradise
```
Config: 70% investors, 20% balanced, 10% extractors
Result: High-energy equilibrium, but fragile to extractor invasion
```

### 4. Large Scale
```
Config: 80×80 grid, 300 agents, balanced strategies
Result: Complex spatial patterns, regional differentiation
```

## 📈 Metrics to Watch

### System Health
- **Total System Energy**: Agent energy + ecosystem resources
- **Energy Distribution**: How balanced is it?
- **Average r̄**: Are agents learning long-term thinking?

### Population Dynamics
- **Alive Agents**: Is population sustainable?
- **Extractor vs Investor Ratio**: Who's winning?
- **Strategy Shifts**: How fast does evolution happen?

### Ecosystem Quality
- **Average Cell Resources**: Is the grid depleted or abundant?
- **Average Cell Friction**: Is infrastructure improving?
- **Spatial Patterns**: Are there regional differences?

## 💡 Project Vision

**This simulation proves that math can guide design.**

**What we demonstrate:**
- Predictive agency > myopic optimization (mathematically)
- The Beaver Test reveals truth about systems
- Boundaries matter more than intentions
- Long-term thinking emerges from average-reward RL

**Why it matters:**
- Token platforms fail the Beaver Test
- Collective action achieves higher efficiency
- Scale cannot save extractive fundamentals
- AI alignment requires optimizing the right timescale

## 🎯 Success Criteria

We'll know this project succeeds when:
1. People use it to analyze real systems (rideshare, social media, supply chains)
2. The framework influences platform design decisions
3. Academic papers cite the theoretical contributions
4. The Beaver Test becomes shorthand for system evaluation
