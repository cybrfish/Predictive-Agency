## üìä What It Does

### The Experiment
Watch 100+ agents learn to balance extraction vs investment in a living ecosystem.

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Extractor waves**: Locusts that deplete regions and move on
- **Investor clusters**: Beavers that build resource-rich zones
- **Population cycles**: Boom ‚Üí crash ‚Üí recovery
- **Spatial patterns**: Wasteland vs wetland formation
- **Strategy evolution**: Successful behaviors propagate

### Key Insights Demonstrated
1. **Free energy alone doesn't tell the story** (distribution matters)
2. **Scale doesn't save extractive systems** (math proves it)
3. **Boundaries determine perception** (local vs global optimization)
4. **Long-term thinking emerges naturally** (rÃÑ converges)

## üöß What's Next (Priority Roadmap)

### **URGENT** - Fix The Foundation
These are blockers for realistic behavior:

1. **Infinite Game Implementation**
   - Remove boundary artifacts (agents clustering at edges)
   - Implement toroidal topology or infinite scrolling viewport
   - Scale movement costs properly
   - No special edge cases

2. **Gaussian Belief Propagation**
   - Partial observability (noisy local observations)
   - Factor graph representation
   - Local updates before global awareness
   - Emergent coordination through imperfect models

3. **Runtime Parameter Controls**
   - Expose movement cost sliders
   - Dynamic friction coefficients
   - Investment efficiency tuning
   - Regeneration rate controls
   - Make EVERYTHING configurable at runtime

### High Priority - Add Realism

4. **Shifting Boundaries & Alliances**
   - Coalition formation
   - Dynamic group boundaries
   - Emergent hierarchies
   - Agents that span multiple groups

5. **Multi-Agent Types**
   - **Platform agents** (adaptive take rates)
   - **Driver agents** (labor, can become autonomous)
   - **Regulator agents** (enforce constraints)
   - **Investor agents** (capital allocation)

6. **Regenerative Rideshare Scenario**
   - Adaptive pricing based on system health
   - Automation transition (drivers ‚Üí autonomous vehicles)
   - Marginalized group inclusion mechanics
   - Dynamic take rate that responds to reality

### Medium Priority - Enhance Visualization

7. **Explicit Boundary Detection**
   - Cluster agents spatially (DBSCAN)
   - Compute r* per cluster
   - Visualize alignment coefficient
   - Demonstrate Beaver Test in action

8. **Power & Agency Metrics**
   - Shapley value computation
   - Counterfactual contribution
   - k_i tracking (circulation - extraction)

9. **Better Visualizations**
   - Sankey energy flows
   - Agent trails
   - Power field heatmap
   - 3D terrain view

### Low Priority
10. Additional scenarios (supply chain, financial markets)
11. Audio feedback
12. Real-world data integration

## üêõ Known Issues & Critical Limitations

### Current Blockers

**‚ö†Ô∏è Finite Game Problem**
The simulation runs as a finite game. It needs to be infinite‚Äîno special boundary conditions. Agents cluster at edges because boundaries exist. In an infinite game (Jevons Paradox territory), there's no upper bound to value generation. The ecosystem can thrive indefinitely under the right conditions.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Static Parameters**
Many critical values are hardcoded that should be runtime sliders:
- Movement cost scaling (currently fixed)
- Friction coefficients (should vary dynamically)
- Investment efficiency (locked, needs tuning)
- Regeneration rates (static, should respond to system state)

**‚ö†Ô∏è No Gaussian Belief Propagation**
Agents have perfect information. Real predictive agency requires:
- Partial observability (agents see noisy local info)
- GBP for distributed inference
- Local pockets reacting before global awareness
- Emergent coordination through imperfect models

**‚ö†Ô∏è Boundary Conditions Break Realism**
Grid edges create artificial behavior. Need:
- Toroidal topology (wraparound) or
- Infinite scrolling viewport or
- Proper boundary weighting

**‚ö†Ô∏è No Shifting Alliances**
Agents act individually. Missing:
- Coalition formation
- Dynamic boundaries between groups
- Emergent processes (like platforms) that span multiple agents
- Hierarchical structures

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ Energy death spiral (regeneration works)
- ‚úÖ No recovery mechanism (respawn works)
- ‚úÖ Static strategies (evolution works)

## üß™ Recommended Experiments

Try these to see interesting behavior:

### 1. Extractor Dominance
```
Config: 80% extractors, 10% investors, 10% balanced
Result: Watch system collapse then recover as investors take over
```

### 2. Resource Shock
```
Action: Start balanced, then hit "Deplete Center" at t=500
Result: Agent migration patterns, strategy shifts
```

### 3. Investor Paradise
```
Config: 70% investors, 20% balanced, 10% extractors
Result: High-energy equilibrium, but fragile to extractor invasion
```

### 4. Large Scale
```
Config: 80√ó80 grid, 300 agents, balanced strategies
Result: Complex spatial patterns, regional differentiation
```

## üìà Metrics to Watch

### System Health
- **Total System Energy**: Agent energy + ecosystem resources
- **Energy Distribution**: How balanced is it?
- **Average rÃÑ**: Are agents learning long-term thinking?

### Population Dynamics
- **Alive Agents**: Is population sustainable?
- **Extractor vs Investor Ratio**: Who's winning?
- **Strategy Shifts**: How fast does evolution happen?

### Ecosystem Quality
- **Average Cell Resources**: Is the grid depleted or abundant?
- **Average Cell Friction**: Is infrastructure improving?
- **Spatial Patterns**: Are there regional differences?

## üí° Project Vision

**This simulation proves regenerative economics is mathematically viable.**

### The Jevons Paradox for Intelligence

More efficiency ‚Üí more consumption (always, in history).  
More AI capability ‚Üí more compute usage (happening now).  
**There is no upper bound to value generation.**

The question: Over what timescale do individual and ecosystem health align?

### From Extractive to Regenerative

**Extractive platforms:**
- Optimize for monopoly
- Extract maximum value
- Resist automation (threatens control)
- Rigid smart contracts unresponsive to reality

**Regenerative platforms:**
- Optimize for long-term health
- Take only what's needed for maintenance
- **Welcome automation** (costs drop ‚Üí prices drop)
- Adaptive systems responsive to:
  - Worker welfare (including platform maintainers)
  - User fairness
  - Marginalized group inclusion
  - Environmental impact
  - **The holonic whole, not just individuals**

### The Math Makes It Real

Differential Q-learning with:
- Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP)
- Gaussian Belief Propagation (imperfect world models)
- Average-reward optimization (infinite horizon)
- Stochastic programming (adaptive response)
- Dynamic boundaries (shifting alliances)

**Result**: Systems that adjust to reality, not founder whims.

When automation replaces drivers, regenerative platforms lower prices. Extractive platforms capture surplus.

**We can predict which settings create which future.**
